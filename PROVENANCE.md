# PROVENANCE & ANTI-PLAGIARISM NOTES

This repository uses the following practices to help establish authorship and deter plagiarism:

1. **AGPL-3.0 license (pre-publication)**: Derivative works must remain open-source if distributed.
2. **Signed Releases & Tags**: Create a signed git tag (e.g., `v1.0.0-preprint`) for this exact version.
3. **Checksums**: Publish SHA256 checksums of release artifacts.
4. **CITATION.cff**: Provides machine-readable citation metadata.
5. **Reproducible Scripts**: Deterministic seeds, pinned requirements.
6. **(Optional) Preprint**: Consider uploading a preprint (e.g., arXiv) to register timestamped precedence.
7. **Private During Review**: Keep the repo private and provide editors with access; switch public after acceptance.

> Replace this file with concrete release notes and checksums when you publish an official release.
